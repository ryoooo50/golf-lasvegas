The team score is formed by combining the two scores (e.g., 4 and 5 becomes 45).\nThe difference between team scores is the points exchanged.\n\nBirdie Flip:\nIf a team gets a birdie (under par), the opponent team's score is flipped (e.g. 45 -> 54), often resulting in a larger loss.\n\nPush:\nDoubles the points for the current hole. Can be used limited times per half.\n\nCarryOver:\nIf scores are tied, points carry over to the next hole (multiplier increases)."
